# [docker-archlinux-aur][docker-link]

This docker container is based on [greyltc's archlinux container][archlinux-aur]
with `aur` support.

It provides the full latex suite based on `texlive` and
[`pandoc`](https://pandoc.org/) support.

In addition to that, [`textidote`](https://sylvainhalle.github.io/textidote/) is
installed, which is a latex wrapper for [`LanguageTool`](languagetool.org/) and
can be used as a latex and grammar correction tool.
